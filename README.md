# Akshay-Raj__02739__Electricity-Usage-Predictor
E⚡ Electricity Usage Predictor
A Python project for PS No. 62 that analyses historical monthly electricity consumption, fits a simple linear regression model, predicts usage for a selected future month, estimates the bill, and visualises the trend.

The original console-based workflow is retained in electricity_predictor.py. A Flask web interface is also included so the project can be used in a browser and deployed as a Python web service on Render.\n\n## 🌐 HTML5 Project Overview\n\nExplore the project's purpose, workflow, regression model, technology stack, and local setup in the standalone HTML5 overview:\n\n**Open Electricity Usage Predictor — Project Overview**

✨ Features
Load monthly usage records from a CSV file using Pandas.
Validate missing, non-numeric, negative, and duplicate values.
Fit a degree-1 regression line with NumPy polyfit().
Calculate slope, intercept, and coefficient of determination (R²).
Predict electricity usage for a user-selected month.
Estimate the bill at the assignment rate of ₹6 per unit.
Plot actual usage, the regression line, and the predicted point with Matplotlib.
Handle the minimum-data case: at least two valid months are required.
Use the original console application or the browser-based Flask interface.

🚀 Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ayushkumarxy/Akshay-Raj__02739__Electricity-Usage-Predictor.git
cd Akshay-Raj__02739__Electricity-Usage-Predictor
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
Windows (PowerShell):

py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
macOS / Linux:

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Start the web application
python app.py
Open [https://akshay-raj-02739-electricity-usage.onrender.com) in your browser, upload a CSV file, enter the month to predict, and submit.

Run the original console version
python electricity_predictor.py
The console program reads usage.csv from the project directory.

📄 CSV Format
Both header and headerless CSV files are supported.

Month,Units
1,200
2,220
3,240
4,260
Or:

1,200
2,220
3,240
4,260
Rules:

The CSV must contain at least two columns: Month and Units.
Month values must be positive and unique.
Units must be numeric and cannot be negative.
At least two valid data rows are required.
🧮 How the Model Works
The application fits a straight line:

Units = slope × Month + intercept
NumPy's polyfit(month, units, 1) calculates the slope and intercept. The fitted values are then used to calculate R²:

R² = 1 - (sum of squared residuals / total sum of squares)
The bill estimate is:

Estimated Bill = Predicted Units × ₹6
R² measures how closely the fitted line matches the uploaded historical data. It is not a guarantee of future prediction accuracy. Predictions far beyond the observed months are extrapolations and should be interpreted cautiously. The ₹6 rate is the fixed assignment assumption, not a complete real-world tariff.

🧪 Assignment Test Cases
The project brief specifies these expected outcomes:

Test case	Input	Expected result
Normal input	(1,120), (2,220), (3,240), (4,260)	Slope 20, intercept 180, Month 5 = 280 units, bill ₹1,680
Minimum input	(1,100), (2,150)	Slope 50, intercept 50, Month 3 = 200 units, bill ₹1,200
Invalid input	One data row only	Error: at least 2 months are required
Different valid data	(1,100), (2,120), (3,150), (4,170)	Slope 24, intercept 75, R² ≈ 0.99, Month 6 = 219 units, bill ₹1,314
Note: the first case above follows the assignment's expected output values. The repository's usage.csv is a separate sample dataset.

☁️ Deploy on Render
This repository includes a render.yaml Blueprint configuration.

Sign in to Render and choose New → Blueprint (or create a Web Service).
Connect the GitHub repository: Ayushkumarxy/Akshay-Raj__02739__Electricity-Usage-Predictor.
If creating a Web Service manually, select:
Runtime: Python
Build command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start command: gunicorn app:app
Deploy and wait for the build to finish.
Open the generated .onrender.com URL and test it with a CSV upload.
No environment variables or external database are required. The app listens on Render's assigned PORT.

⚠️ Limitations
This is a learning project using simple linear regression and a small history of monthly data.
Real electricity tariffs may include fixed charges, taxes, and slab-based pricing; the app uses the assignment's flat ₹6/unit rate.
A high R² on a small dataset does not guarantee accurate future forecasts.
Uploaded CSV data is processed for the request and is not saved as a user account or permanent dataset.
